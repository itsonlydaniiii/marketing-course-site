#Key Challenges
One of the most exciting challenges I encountered during this project was implementing the Courses Page with progress tracking. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the challenges faced and solutions applied:
- Progress Tracking Implementation: Developing a feature to track course completion progress involved creating a dynamic interface that updates as users complete different modules. This required extensive use of JavaScript to handle user interactions and maintain accurate progress records.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the website remains user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes was a significant challenge. I used CSS media queries and flexible layouts to address this.
- Dynamic Content Management: Managing and displaying course information dynamically was another challenge. I utilized JavaScript to dynamically load and update course content based on user interactions.
